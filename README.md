URI Online Judge is a project developed by the Computer Science Department of URI University.

In this repository I will add all my resolutions of URI's problems. The problems can be about math, graphs,
strings problems, data structs and more.

I will add the problem in a .pdf file and the answer in .c file or .cpp file.
